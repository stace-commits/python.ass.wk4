*File Read & Write Challenge*  
Create a program that reads a file, modifies its content, and writes it to a new file. Demonstrate file handling by transforming text (e.g., uppercase, reverse) or processing data. Ensure the program handles large files efficiently and maintains original formatting where needed.  

*Error Handling Lab*  
Prompt users for a filename and gracefully handle errors like missing files or read permissions. Use try-except blocks to provide clear feedback, ensuring the program doesnâ€™t crash. Test with invalid inputs to verify robustness.
